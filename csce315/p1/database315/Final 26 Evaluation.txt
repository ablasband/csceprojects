“These multipliers are a true and accurate assessment of our relative contributions on the project.  We all agree that that these are honest evaluations and are satisfied with the final decision.”

Explanation:
+ Ryan Q-dropped the course after writing 2 or 3 helper functions, and   	
  did not notify the rest of the team until the night the database was 
  due.  

	 + He caused serious problems (as we had delegated work to him that 				
	     we had to pick up immediately before the project was due).	
     + The other team had been attempting to contact him, and he gave  
         them no response that he was no longer a part of the project.  
	 + We found out, also the day the database was due, that Ryan had 
	   	 sent our alternate team a DLL file but forgotten the LIB file, 
	   	 and they had been attempting to reach him all week looking for 
	   	 the LIB.  We managed to get them a LIB file, but it may have 
	   	 been too late for them to use our database.  
 
 + Sarah and I (Graham) equally and fairly divided the work ourselves, 
   and saw that it was done.
